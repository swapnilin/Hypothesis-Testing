## Context:
ExperienceMyServices reported that a typical American spends an average of 144 minutes (2.4 hours) per day accessing the Internet via a mobile device with a standard deviation of 110 minutes.

## Key Question:Â¶
Is there enough statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean time spent per day accessing the Internet via mobile device is different from 144 minutes? Use the p-value approach and a level of significance of 0.05.
