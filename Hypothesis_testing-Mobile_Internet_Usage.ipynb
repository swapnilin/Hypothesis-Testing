    "# Introduction to Hypothesis Testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. It involves formulating a `null` and `alternative` hypotheses, selecting an appropriate test statistic, determining a significance level, and making a decision based on the test results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Question\n",
    "\n",
    "ExperienceMyServices reported that a typical American spends an average of 144 minutes (2.4 hours) per day accessing the Internet via a mobile device with a standard deviation of 110 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the validity of this statement, you collected 30 samples from friends and family. The results for the time spent per day accessing the Internet via a mobile device (in minutes) are stored in \"InternetMobileTime.csv\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Is there enough statistical evidence to conclude that the population mean time spent per day accessing the Internet via mobile device is different from 144 minutes? Use the p-value approach and a level of significance of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We can assume that the samples are randomly selected, independent, and come from a normally distributed population"

    "### Important Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Level of significance:** often denoted by the symbol Œ± (alpha), is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true. In hypothesis testing, it represents the threshold for considering a result statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence interval:** is a range of values that likely contains the true population parameter. It is typically expressed as a percentage and represents the level of certainty or confidence in our estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the `confidence interval` and the `level of significance` are related but represent different concepts in statistical inference. The confidence interval provides a range of plausible values for the population parameter, while the level of significance dictates the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a significance level of Œ± = 0.05, it means that we are willing to accept a 5% chance of making a Type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when it's actually true). This corresponds to a 95% confidence level for the confidence interval, meaning that we are 95% confident that the true population parameter falls within the calculated interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mathematically, the relationship can be expressed as follows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Confidence level = 1 - Œ±`\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if Œ± = 0.05, then the confidence level would be 1 - 0.05 = 0.95, or 95%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if Œ± = 0.01, then the confidence level would be 1 - 0.01 = 0.99, or 99%."
